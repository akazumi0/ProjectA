## ⚡ Integration Quick Start

### After Downloading Graphics:

1. **Extract all ZIP files** to their respective folders
2. **Organize sprites** by category (fragments, particles, UI, etc.)
3. **Create sprite sheets** if needed (use tools like TexturePacker or manual CSS sprites)
4. **Update game code** to load images instead of procedural rendering:

```javascript
// Example: Load fragment sprite
const fragmentImage = new Image();
fragmentImage.src = '/Assets/Graphics/fragments/star-01.png';

// Use in canvas rendering
ctx.drawImage(fragmentImage, x, y, width, height);
```

### After Downloading Music:

1. **Place MP3 files** in `/Assets/Music/ambient/`
2. **Create playlist** in `audio.js`:

```javascript
const musicTracks = {
  ambient: [
    { name: 'Space Ambient 01', file: '/Assets/Music/ambient/track01.mp3' },
    { name: 'Space Ambient 02', file: '/Assets/Music/ambient/track02.mp3' }
  ]
};
```

3. **Add attribution** to credits file

### After Downloading Sounds:

1. **Organize by category** (ui/, gameplay/, events/)
2. **Integrate into audio system**:

```javascript
const soundEffects = {
  click: new Audio('/Assets/Sounds/ui/click-01.wav'),
  capture: new Audio('/Assets/Sounds/gameplay/capture-01.wav'),
  achievement: new Audio('/Assets/Sounds/events/achievement-unlock.wav')
};
```
